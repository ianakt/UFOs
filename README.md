  Along with these search criteria are the comments associated with each sighting are inlcuded.
  
  ## Summary:
  
  Based on the data provided, most of the sightings were in the US except one in CA, with that said it would be beneficial to add a map to the site. Also going through the comments there are common threads that deserves their own columns which are:
  -The number of lights observed
  - The color of the light
  - altitude (though not mentioned in majority of cases)

The # of lights and the color could be added as separate columns, to the table using a javascript function that searches the string of each comment state menton for a color, and a number (of type string that would be converted to a number of type number)
